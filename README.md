# map-pathfind
Breadth-first maze pathfinding in Java.

The maze is thanks to Henry Kroll III, thenerdshow.com
For an example, go to: http://thenerdshow.com/amaze.html?rows=10&cols=10&color=FF0000&bgcolor=000000&sz=10px&blank=+&wall=%23#.Vh_t0BNVikp
Proper format is maze in a .txt with no empty lines either before or after.
